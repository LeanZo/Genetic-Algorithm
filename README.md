# Genetic-Algorithm
### Welcome to LeanZo's Genetic Algorithm! 

This program is inspired by the proccess of natural selection. Genetic algorithms are used to generate high-quality and optimized solution using principles as mutation and natural selection.

This program operates on the following manner: There is a 'population', filled with 'beings', each of these having traits represented by the old eight deadly sins. These traits have a range of 0 to 100. The user sets a goal.The program runs. For each 'being' of the first generation it sets random traits values, then the program calculates the average of these traits. The 'being' which average is closer to the goal lives on and a new generation is created, filled with clones of this 'being'. The clones are mutated randomily. The once again the program search for the 'being' closer to the goal. This proccess goes on until a 'being' with average equal to the goal is found.
